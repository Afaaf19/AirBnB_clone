##DESCRIPTION: 
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because I will use what I build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

##ENVIRONMENT: 

All my files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python


##REQUIREMENTS: 

the main thing in this project is to deal with a command line interpreter
